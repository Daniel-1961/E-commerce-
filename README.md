# E-commerce Platform (Backend + Frontend)

**E-commerce** is a full stack e-commerce project built with a JavaScript-based backend and frontend.  
This repository contains the evolving codebase for an online store application where users can browse products, add items to cart, and place orders. The backend API is under active development, and some integration parts are still in progress.

## Overview
This project aims to simulate a real-world e-commerce system as part of my Learning curve for full-stack developement. It’s a learning project focused on building RESTful APIs that can support common e-commerce functionalities such as:

- User registration & authentication
- Product catalog browsing
- Shopping cart management
- Order creation
- Admin product management
The backend is built using JavaScript (Node.js, Express), while the frontend is prepared separately — both live in this repository for full stack structure.
